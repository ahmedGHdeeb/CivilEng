_Basic Problem in Dynamics:
Loads are in term of (x, y, z, t), where t is time, so loads are defined with respect to the variation of time

_Are all loads that varies with time can be called Dynamic?
No, for example when lectures are started the halls with be filled and when collages closes their doors and all leave
this called a Live Load

_Dynamic loads:
the loads that change with respect to time and creates vibration in the system inwhcih the load is acting

_Vibration:
the process of continuous exchange of potential energy to kinetic energy and vice versa

_Period:
if a vibratory motion repeats itself in equal intervals of time, it is ccalled a periodic motion

_Frequency:
the numbers of times that the vibrating movement repeats itslef in the Periodic vibration time

Displacement is related to the stiffness of the material and this is releated to the potential energy
Acceleration is related to the inertia of the body and this is releated to the kinetic energy

_Basic Components of Vibration:
Potential Energy -> Displacement <=> Stiffness
Kinetic Energy -> Acceleration <=> Inertia
Dissipation / Loss of energy -> Damping
the sum of the potential and kinetic energy must be constant except if there was losses of energy / Dissipation and its called Damper or Damping
